<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm currently a second year graduate student from [Sun Yat-sun University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn) under the supervision of [Prof. Liang Chen](https://chenliang.tech).
I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xiaowei Yang](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/2018/0615/c16788a270764/page.htm).

My primary research interests lie in Graph Neural Networks, Recommender Systems. I'm also interested in Large Language Models and its applications.
